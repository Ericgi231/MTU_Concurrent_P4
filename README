Question 1:
When the landlord wants to enter the room they signal that they are present
and call Wait() on an in blocking and out blocking mutex
The first thing a student does after getting in the door is check if
the landlord is present, if so, they Wait() on the appropriate blocking mutex
before doing so they free the door mutex assuring that the landlord is allowed in
Only once the landlord is done checking does the in blocking mutex get Signaled
This signal tells a student that was pushed out of the door that they may
get back in the door and continue their entry

Question 2:
When a student enters the room that had 0 students in it, they flip a 
clear mutex to 0
When a student leaves the room that had 1 student in it, they flip a
clear mutex to 1
after the landlord declares that the room needs to be empty, he allows
students to leave but not enter, he then waits on the clear mutex
followed by signaling it. This means he can only progress after the
last student leaves and sets the mutex to 1, he then makes sure it
remains at 1 after he leaves as to allow for the first student to enter
to then set it back to 0 without halting

Question 3:
The students are aware of how many students exist
When the landlord is ready to retire he allows all students to 
enter and exit. Entering students will instantly die
The landlord then waits on a retirement mutex that starts at 0
this means the landlord must wait till the mutex is singaled
When a student dies they increase a death counter
If a student dies and the death counter is equal to total students
they signal the retirement mutex which then frees the landlord
to retire.
